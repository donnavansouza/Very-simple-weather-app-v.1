# My First Node.js Weather App

Hello there.
Welcome to my first publication on GitHub! This very simple app uses weather data from the Open-Meteo API and the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API. Thank you for checking it out, and I hope you enjoy it!

## Getting Started

To get the app up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install the npm packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install or simply npm i
   ```

### Configuration

To use the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API, you will need an API key. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Get your API key:**
   Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) and obtain your API key.

2. **Set up your environment variable:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key:
   ```
   API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
   ```

### Running the App

Start the app using Node.js:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

## Future Improvements

This is just the beginning! I plan to improve and add more features to this app. Stay tuned for updates.
